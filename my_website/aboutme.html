   <div style="border: 1px solid black">About Me
  <pre>
       My name is Johana Diaz and I'm a student at the Palmdale Aerospace Academy.

       I'm currently a senior and part of Link Crew (aka I pulled little Billy's
       out of cars).
       
       I want to be a lawyer in the future so I don't really know why I'm at an 
       engineering school, but its cool I guess.
       
       I like to paint but I'm a perfectionist so that makes for an interesting combintation.
